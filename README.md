Power BI Dashboard + Machine Learning Pipeline

This project combines interactive health analytics with a predictive machine learning model to understand and forecast diabetes risk using a public health dataset of 170,000+ records from the CDC.
It integrates Power BI (EDA & visualization) and Python (prediction & modeling) to deliver a complete, end-to-end analytics solution.

🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to identify key demographic, lifestyle, and cardiovascular factors associated with diabetes, and to build a predictive model capable of estimating an individual’s diabetes risk.
The project includes:

Power BI dashboards for interactive exploratory data analysis

Python-based ML pipeline for classification

Behavioral and demographic insights for health decision-making
